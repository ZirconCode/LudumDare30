UltraRealistic Moon Wrecking Ball Simulator
===========

-> bin/index.html to play if downloaded
-> Can be played online at http://www.zirconcode.com/ludumdare30/index.html

For the Ludum Dare 30 competition "Connected Worlds" at www.ludumdare.com/compo/

I only had a day for this one but I'm happy how it turned out. My only regret is the lack of music (and I wish I had time to place a small iconic pop-star on the wrecking ball moon"). Had tons of fun making it =)

Everything written by me in Java, no libraries used, no engines, based on a tiny applet framework of mine (ZirconCode/BasicGameApplet on github). I used bfxr.net to create the sound effects. GIMP for the stunning visuals. Full Source Included of Course.

Enjoy!
